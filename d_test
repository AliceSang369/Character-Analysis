You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor  an' Nicolas Flamel --" "Aha!"
" again," he said, "He was the first one I ever-" He gasped.
Sir, quick --" "Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times," said .
For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from 's eyes seemed to have gone out.

"We wondered who  had trusted enough to help him, apart from you."

This man's name was Albus .
"That's what I said, but  thinks that -- what was it?

"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as 's around.
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at  here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on.
"I had no idea, when  told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn't know.

"But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead -- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -" "Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as  stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
"Good afternoon, Harry," said .
Then he said slowly, "It shows us what we want... whatever we want..." "Yes and no," said  quietly.
"See Professor ?"
